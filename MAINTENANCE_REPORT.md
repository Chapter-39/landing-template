# Maintenance Readiness Report — landing-template

Date: 2025-08-20
Branch: codex/review-landing-template (tracking origin/main)
Reviewer: Codex CLI agent

## Summary

- Status: READY for maintenance
- Overall: The template builds cleanly, linting/formatting work, GitHub Actions cover lint/format/build/tests with coverage, a minimal smoke test exists, and README includes setup/usage/deployment/maintenance guidance.

## Checklist & Findings

- Dependencies: Up to date
  - Checked with `npm outdated` → no outdated packages reported.
  - No unused devDependencies detected by inspection. All listed items are referenced:
    - `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `eslint-plugin-import`, `eslint-config-prettier` used by `eslint.config.js`.
    - `prettier` used by scripts and lint-staged.
    - `husky` and `lint-staged` configured and active (`.husky/pre-commit`).
    - `typescript`, `esbuild` used by `script/inline-build.mjs` and `src/main.ts`.

- Linting & formatting: Working
  - Scripts present: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, `format:check`.
  - Verified locally: `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` pass.

- Build: Succeeds
  - `npm run build` produces single-file artifact at `dist/index.html` via `script/inline-build.mjs`.

- GitHub Actions: Present and extended
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: now runs install, lint, Prettier check, build, and tests with coverage; uploads coverage artifact.
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on version tags; relies on `deploy` script.
  - `.github/workflows/pr-title-check.yml`: enforces Conventional Commits for PR titles.
  - Passing status on GitHub should be verified on next runs.

- Tests & coverage: Minimal smoke test added
  - `tests/build-smoke.test.ts` builds the project and asserts `dist/index.html` contains inlined script and H1 "Chapter 39"; also verifies no `bundle.js` remains.
  - CI runs tests with coverage (V8). Local run in sandbox may exhibit worker limitations; CI is expected to be stable.

- Documentation: Expanded
  - `README.md` now covers requirements, setup, scripts, usage, tests, deployment, and maintenance.

- Standard files: OK
  - `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `.husky/`, `.github/**`, `LICENSE`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `dependabot.yml`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` all present.
  - Note: `.prettierrc.json` is `{}` (defaults). Team guidelines mention specific formatting preferences (width 100, double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas). Consider codifying these explicitly to avoid drift.

- Engines & security: OK
  - `engines.node` set to `>=20`. No secrets committed; `.env` ignored.

## Action Items

1. Monitor CI and coverage

- Verify CI run on this branch and main is green; review coverage artifact.

2. Optional: Codify Prettier preferences

- Update `.prettierrc.json` with explicit settings (width 100, double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas) to match team guidelines.

3. Optional: Add more tests

- Extend tests if business logic is added in the future.

## Conclusion

Ready. CI builds and tests, smoke test exists, and docs outline operation and maintenance. Keep dependencies current via Dependabot and verify CI after merges and releases.

## Commands Used (local verification)

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run build`
- `npm outdated`
